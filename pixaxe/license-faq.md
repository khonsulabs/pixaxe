# License FAQ

The [Pixaxe License](./pixaxe/LICENSE.md) is a modified version of the
[Functional Source License](https://fsl.software/).

## Why modify the Functional Source License?

The Functional Source license defines competing use using the term "commercial,"
which by most definitions requires a good or service to be exchanged for
something of value. Because Pixaxe is attempting to be fully source available
and minimally commercialized, one possible loss of revenue is package
maintainers removing some or all aspects of monetization and distributing the
resulting application free of charge. Under the Functional Source License, that
may be an allowed usage.

The Pixaxe License substitutes the word "commercial" for "distributed" to
disallow some forms of redistribution. Specifically, the inability to
redistribute an altered version of Pixaxe that intends to be a "substitute" for
the licensed version of Pixaxe.

This change is aimed at allowing this project to be free and source-available
during a reasonable period of commercial exclusivity and become fully
open-source after the exclusive period.
